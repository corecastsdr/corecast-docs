# Hosting Your Own Core Cast Server

This guide provides the complete steps to deploy a secure, production-ready Core Cast server using Docker and Docker Compose.

## How It Works: Secure, Dynamic Setup

The Core Cast server uses a secure, dynamic method to handle the SDR host's SSH connection. This process is designed to be secure by default and **avoids hardcoding any passwords**.

Here is the flow:

1.  **You (Admin)** run the `./setup.sh` script *once* on your server.
2.  **`setup.sh`** generates two things:
      * `./ssh_keys/`: The unique SSH host keys for your server.
      * `./.env`: A **new file** that contains a secure, randomly generated password (e.g., `CORECAST_HOST_PASSWORD=...`).
3.  **Docker Compose** reads the `./.env` file when you run `docker-compose up`.
4.  **`entrypoint.sh`** (inside the container) receives the password as an environment variable. It then creates the special `sdr_host` user and sets its password dynamically *at runtime*.
5.  **`sshd_config`** (the server's SSH config) is set up to **only allow this user** and to **force-run** a connection script, making it a highly secure, single-purpose login.

:::info[Why this is secure]
The Docker *image* itself contains no secrets. The password lives only in the `.env` file on your host machine and is injected at runtime, which is a security best practice.

## 1\. Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have the following tools installed on your server:

  * **Git**
  * **Docker**
  * **Docker Compose**

-----

## 2\. Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the Core Cast repository onto your server and navigate into the `server` directory.

```bash
# Clone the main repository
git clone https://github.com/corecastsdr/corecast-server.git

# Navigate into the server directory
cd corecast-server/server
```

### Step 2: Run the One-Time Setup Script

Next, you need to run the setup script. This will create the `.env` file and generate your server's unique SSH keys.

```bash
# Make the setup script executable
sudo chmod +x setup.sh

# Run the script
./setup.sh
```

:::warning[IMPORTANT: Save Your Password\!]
The setup script will output the randomly generated password for the `corecast-host` user. **You must provide this password to the operator of the remote SDR hardware.**

🔑 This password is also saved in the `.env` file if you need to find it later.
:::

### Step 3: Create the Docker Network

The Core Cast server and its related services (like the API) communicate over a dedicated Docker network. You must create this network manually.

```bash
# Create the external network
sudo docker network create corecast_net
```

This is required because the `docker-compose.yml` file specifies the network as `external: true`.

### Step 4: Build and Run the Container

You're now ready to build and start the server. We use the `--build` flag to build the image locally and `-d` to run it in detached (background) mode.

```bash
sudo docker-compose up --build -d
```

## ✅ Your server is now running\!!!

## 3\. Managing Your Server

### Stopping and Removing the Server

The simplest way to stop and remove all the containers, networks, and volumes defined in the compose file is with a single command:

```bash
# The standard way to stop and remove
sudo docker-compose down
```

If you need to forcefully remove *only* the `corecast-server` container (for example, if it's stuck), you can use one of these more aggressive commands.

```bash
# Force-remove by name (if you used the default docker-compose.yml)
sudo docker rm -f corecast-server 2>/dev/null || true

# OR
# Find the container by name, get its ID, and force-remove it
sudo docker ps -a --filter name=corecast-server --format '{{.ID}}' | xargs -r sudo docker rm -f
```

### Starting the Server

To start the server again after it's been stopped:

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

### Rebuilding the Image

If you've made changes to the `Dockerfile` or related files, you can rebuild the image and restart the server with one command:

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d --build
```
